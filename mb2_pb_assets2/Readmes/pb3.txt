CREDIT LIST CUSTOM PLAYER MODELS, WEAPON MODELS, HILTS AND EXTRAS


In this file i have compiled all of the skins, weapon models and sounds which i ported from external, non-official MBII/JKA sources.
This in the form of files from jkhub.org, gamefront.com or large skinpacks made by members of the MBII community.

Aside from the ported files, i created the custom soundpacks and/or character icons for most player models myself
as well as frankensteined a few extra models of which i will credit the original creators and/or sources as well.

Of some models i could not find an original creator/source so those will be credited under the skinpack where i found them.

Most soundfiles have been compiled by using instant mp3 files, though many also pulled from youtube or the actual main sources.
