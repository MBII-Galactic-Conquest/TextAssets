Details:

Some of the cultists in the Disciples of Ragnos were imbued particularly with force energy only to be trained to use specific force powers at a mastery that could equal that of one who had trained for many years. Since they do not have any lightsaber to defend themselves with, cultists are provided with thicker armor and cortosis weave. This Particular Cultist wears a red battle suit and implements force drain as its primary force power. These Cultists are particularly effective when used in groups with cultists of other force masteries, since their combined force techniques can outmatch that of any one Jedi."
