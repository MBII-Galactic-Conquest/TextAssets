Han Solo and Chewbacca were sent to assess the situation on Kashyyyk, and to assist if they could with the liberation of Kashyyyk.
What even the quick-witted smuggler saw on Kashyyyk shocked him, and he worked even harder on a plan on how to free Kashyyyk from the imperial oppression.
Han Solo likes quick weapons as he likes quick wits, and carries his famed pistol where ever he goes, however, he's taking a few other tricks with him this time. 
Grenade in the face anyone?"
