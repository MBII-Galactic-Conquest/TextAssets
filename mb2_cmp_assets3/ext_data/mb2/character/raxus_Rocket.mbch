description	"Enhanced Rocketrooper

Weaponry:
Modified Concussion Rifle (2)

Attributes:
Cortosis Alloy
Blast Armour
Melee Resistant Armour
Reinforced Gauntlets (Strength 3)

Details:
Possibly a variation of the clone jet troopers used during the Clone wars, Rockettroopers were used all of the galaxy for hazardous duties. Many companies had their own design, using jetpacks by Merr-Sonn or Mitrinomon or custom, usually more powerful designs.
This suit here was customized for ranged and melee combat, and while not equipped with a jetpack yet, it's already deadly enough to take on a small army."
