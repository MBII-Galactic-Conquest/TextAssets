description	"Assault Clone Trooper - Enhanced

Weapons:
DC-17 Hand Blaster   (1)
WESTAR-M5 Blaster Rifle   (1)
3 Frag Grenades

Attributes:
Dodge   (2) ^3[CS3]

Description:
While the A280 rifle was not normally part of the Grand Army's weaponry, it is used by some of the more specialist and expert clones who have become veterans in the battlefield.
As a result of their higher status with dangerous weaponry, they have also gained access to explosives that would normally be out of reach.
There are very few however, as most clones are sent on suicide missions, and most don't come back."
