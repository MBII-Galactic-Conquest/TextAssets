Description:
The Co-pilot was there both to make it look like the ship complied with the standard Republic Army rules (every ship must have at least two pilots onboard).
Also, it was very practical for Dooku to use - if the clone pilot 'unexpectedly' died, another person would have to take over and contact the base. If they tried to use someone to contact the base who wasn't wearing clone armor, access would be denied.
After all, the armor might have been damaged, and could not be used - with another pilot, there would at least be another suit of armor."
