Details:

Clone troopers were identical, genetically-modified soldiers bred and trained to serve in the Republic's army during the Clone Wars. This particular clone trooper is a standard clone trooper of the private rank, and make up the bulk of the clone army. These Lieutenant troopers wear heavier blue armor and carry DC-15S Blaster Carbines as their primary weapon. These are most Generally Low-Ranking Officers who lead medium sized squads of regular clone troopers into battle. These Lietenants can serve also as support units by providing allies with much needed ammunition and medical supplies."
