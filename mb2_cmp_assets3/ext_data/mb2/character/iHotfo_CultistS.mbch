Details:

This particular Cultist received the nickname 'Swashbuckler' from it's choice to combine rudimentary force powers with guns; jumping from place to place and firing volleys of dual DL-44 pistol shots. Jedi students often underestimate this cultist as a typical non force user and an easy kill, only to face death by being outmaneuvered and gunned down."
