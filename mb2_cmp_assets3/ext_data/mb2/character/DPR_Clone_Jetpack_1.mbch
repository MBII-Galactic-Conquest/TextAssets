description	"Jet Trooper - Unique

Weapons:
DC-15s Side Arm Blaster   (1)
DC-15A Blaster Rifle   (3)

Equipment:
Jetpack
Regenerative Fuel Cells (3)

Attributes:
Dodge   (2)

Description:
The Jumpjet troopers were famously known during the Clone Wars, primarily because they could jump and jet. These units often got the best equipment to fight with - because the jetpack was more expensive.
All the troopers come with a rechargable jetpack and a fully set rifle to fight with. However, due to the cost of these units, they are only reserved for special missions.
They typically spend most of their time in a base on stand-by awaiting a mission; the real reason: to avoid losing them."
