An Antarian Ranger from Toprawa, who's minor Force abilities continue to develop during her time with Wraith Squadron.

During her training, her commanding officer, Colonel Repness, attempted to persuade her into stealing an X-Wing so it could be sold on the black market. She refused, but was blackmailed into silence with the fact that the officer had been modifying her scores.
After being transferred to Wraith Squadron, her squadmates helped expose the corrupt Repness.

Eventually, Tyria is accepted into the ranks of the Jedi."
