Darth Sion, the Lord of Pain, was a Sith Lord who lived during the Old Sith Wars. He has been struck down many times; through the power of the Dark Side his rage and self-hatred denies the grip of death - allowing him to achive a sort of immortality - at the cost of all-consuming agony and physical decay."
