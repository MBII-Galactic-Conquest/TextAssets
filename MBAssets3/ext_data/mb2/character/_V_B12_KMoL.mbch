Kowakian monkey-lizards, also known as Kowakians, sometimes referred to as monkeys, were a race of semi-sentient reptilian creatures often used by members of the underworld as pets. 
Owners of Kowakians included Jabba Desilijic Tiure, Hondo Ohnaka and Emil Graf. They were capable of using weapons such as the blaster and, in the case of Pikk Mukmuk, a pirate tank. 
One Kowakian became a bounty hunter and turned the Wookiee Chewbacca over to the Galactic Empire. They were related to the much larger Kowakian ape-lizard."
