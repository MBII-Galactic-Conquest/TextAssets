Dia is Wraith Squadron's vehicle specialist and has considerable knowledge of criminal syndicates, which she exploits to the squadron's advantage.

Although showing a tough exterior, Dia is in a fragile mental state, as she spent most of her youth as a slave girl for an Imperial aristocrat. After killing her master and escaping in a stolen fighter, she fled to the New Republic, and joined Wraith Squadron.

She occasionally becomes suicidal, needing the help of her squadmates to recover."
