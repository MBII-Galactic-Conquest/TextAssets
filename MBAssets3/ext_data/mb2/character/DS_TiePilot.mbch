Small Medpack (25HP)

Reinforcements (2)
Close Quarters Combat (Fast Melee Speed)

There were many Tie Pilots on the Death Star. While they lacked heavy armor or the rigorous combat training regular Stormtroopers received, they are lighter on their feet, and are used to using equipment for repairing and maintaining the many ships the Imperial Navy operated with."
