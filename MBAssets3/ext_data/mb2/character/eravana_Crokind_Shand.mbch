description	"Crokind Shand

Weaponry:
Heavy Bore Rifle (1)
- Based on a Clone Rifle

Heavy Melee

A hard-bitten member of Kanjiklub, Crokind Shand was missing an eye and his right leg, injuries suffered during his career as a pit-fighter. His eyepatch and cybernetic leg – rigged to deliver fierce kicks – offered ample evidence that messing with him would be a potentially fatal mistake."
