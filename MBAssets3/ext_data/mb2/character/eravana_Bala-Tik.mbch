Guavian frontman Bala-Tik is familiar with Solo's silver tongue, and won't accept another catalogue of excuses from the Corellian. Although it would undoubtedly be easy to gun Solo down in cold blood and thus live up to the Death Gang name, Bala-Tik knows Solo to be a valuable source of profitable information. In the past, Bala-Tik has shaken moneymaking leads out of Solo, though his patience with the pilot grows razor-thin."
