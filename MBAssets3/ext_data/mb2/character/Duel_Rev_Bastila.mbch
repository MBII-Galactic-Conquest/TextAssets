A promising Jedi Padawan, with a rare and natural affinity for Battle Meditation, Bastila has been key in holding back the tide in the Jedi Civil War against Revan and Malak, albeit barely.
Having drafted a plan in hopes of ushering in a new phase of the war, the Jedi Council has assigned Bastila the task of capturing both Revan and Malak to deprave the Sith Empire of their leaders.
Leading a small strike force in a surprise attack on Revan and Malaks fleet, she and a small team of Jedi have boarded Revans Flagship and engaged him and his Dark Jedi on the Bridge."
